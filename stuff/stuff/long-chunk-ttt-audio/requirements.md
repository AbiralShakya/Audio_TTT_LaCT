# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This research project focuses on developing and evaluating Long Chunk Test-Time Training (LaCT) for audio applications, specifically targeting Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and audio generation tasks. The project aims to investigate how large-chunk test-time training can improve both the quality of audio processing and hardware efficiency compared to traditional transformer architectures. Based on the foundational work "Test-time training done right" (arXiv:2505.23884), this research will adapt and optimize LaCT for audio-specific challenges including temporal dependencies, spectral features, and real-time processing constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Baseline Audio Transformer Implementation
